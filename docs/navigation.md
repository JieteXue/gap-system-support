# Definition And Reference Navigation

The extension provides static definition and reference navigation through the
native VS Code APIs. It uses the existing Tree-sitter parser and does not start
or evaluate a GAP process.

## Editor Behavior

- **Go to Definition** (`F12`) resolves a symbol use to its definition,
  declaration, or available implementations.
- **Find All References** (`Shift+F12`) finds statically recognizable uses in
  the current workspace.
- `Command+click` on macOS or `Ctrl+click` on Windows/Linux follows a symbol
  use to its definition.
- Clicking a definition that has other references opens the native Peek view.
  The selected definition is omitted from the Peek results.
- Clicking a definition with no other references navigates to that definition
  without opening an empty Peek view.

When a declaration has multiple implementations, such as an operation with
several installed methods, all statically recognizable candidates are returned
and VS Code presents its normal location picker.

## Recognized Symbols

Navigation covers lexical variables, parameters, functions, record/component
paths, GAP declaration calls, installation calls, and binding calls. Complete
qualified paths are preserved, so names such as `A.Print` and `B.Print` do not
share reference results.

See [Definition Navigation Coverage](definition-navigation-coverage.md) for the
detailed construct list and static-analysis limits.

## Cross-File Resolution

Literal `Read("path")` chains are followed in source order, including nested
and circular chains. Open documents take precedence over their saved content.
For computed loaders such as `Read(Concatenation(...))`, a guarded workspace
fallback can resolve top-level symbols from `.g`, `.gd`, `.gi`, and `.gap`
files.

Workspace fallback is intentionally static. It does not execute package
initialization, evaluate computed names, or reproduce runtime method dispatch.

## Peek And Reference Rules

Reference collection uses the same symbol classifier as definition navigation:

- lexical scope and shadowing are preserved;
- declaration and implementation sites can be included or excluded according
  to the VS Code request;
- comments and ordinary strings are excluded;
- the selected occurrence is omitted from Peek results;
- qualified record and component paths are matched by their complete name.

## Performance

Workspace file discovery and parsed symbol indexes are cached and invalidated
when relevant workspace files change. Repeated definition, reference, and Hover
requests reuse document trees, file events, and short-lived workspace lookup
caches instead of rescanning the workspace on every request.

Limits in `src/limits.ts` bound document size, cache sizes, and scanned content.
When a limit is reached, the provider returns no static result rather than
blocking the editor.

## Verification

The automated suite covers:

- same-file and cross-file definitions;
- `.gd` declarations and `.gi` implementations;
- multiple installed methods;
- lexical shadowing;
- nested `rec(...)` fields and dotted/component paths;
- Peek behavior with and without references;
- reference exclusion rules and workspace cache reuse;
- Hover resolution that shares the definition model.

Run the complete suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

For manual VS Code testing, build a VSIX with
`npx @vscode/vsce package` or launch an Extension Development Host with `F5`.
